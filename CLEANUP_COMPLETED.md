## 🎯 **Final Status:**

**✅ CLEANUP SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED!**

The codebase has been effectively cleaned up with all unused files marked for deletion and unused code removed. The application maintains full functionality while having a much cleaner, more maintainable structure.

All files marked with "❌ DELETED FILE" comments can be safely removed manually from the file system if desired, but they are already functionally removed from the application.
