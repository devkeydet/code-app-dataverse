## Development Server Rules

**NEVER run `npm run dev` or start the development server automatically.** 

The user already has it running and will manage it themselves. Do not use the `run_in_terminal` tool to execute `npm run dev`, `npm start`, or any development server commands unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Other Notes

- When making changes to the codebase, focus on the specific files and functionality requested
- Always check for compilation errors after making changes
- Follow the existing code patterns and structure when creating new components or pages
